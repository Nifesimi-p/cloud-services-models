## Step 1: Identifying IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS in My Daily Interactions
As I dive deeper into DevOps and cloud computing, I constantly interact with various cloud service models, each serving a unique purpose.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- AWS EC2 – My go-to for deploying applications, offering full control over compute resources.

- Google Compute Engine (GCE) – A solid alternative when experimenting with workloads on GCP.

- Azure Virtual Machines – Useful when exploring multi-cloud strategies.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk – I use this for simplified application deployment without managing infrastructure.

- Google App Engine – A great choice for running FastAPI applications in a serverless environment.

- Heroku – Heroku for small-scale projects and quick deployments.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- GitHub & GitHub Actions – Essential for version control and automating CI/CD pipelines.

- Slack & Microsoft Teams – My primary tools for DevOps collaboration and monitoring alerts.

- Google Drive & Dropbox – Reliable for storing reports, project files, and documentation.

## Step 2: Research on Cloud Provider Offerings
### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
AWS provides a robust ecosystem with services that align well with my DevOps and cloud computing goals:

- Compute – EC2 (IaaS), Lambda (FaaS), Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS)

- Storage – S3, EBS, Glacier

- Networking – VPC, Route 53, API Gateway

- DevOps & Automation – CloudFormation, CodePipeline, Terraform support

- Security – IAM, Shield, GuardDuty

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
GCP also offers a strong cloud infrastructure, and I find its integration capabilities useful for various deployments:

- Compute – Compute Engine (IaaS), App Engine (PaaS), Cloud Run (FaaS)

- Storage – Cloud Storage, Filestore

- Networking – VPC, Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud Armor

- DevOps & Automation – Cloud Build, Deployment Manager, Terraform support

- Security – IAM, Security Command Center
